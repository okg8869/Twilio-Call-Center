For this task, I kept iterating over what I was making. First I made a simple function to send a text, then I was working with the programmable sms to hard code out messages. 

I then found the chatbot functionality and began to work with that. I eventually stumbled onto the Studio tool as well as the AutoPilot tool, and was very happy to learn how easy they were to use.

I used the following scripts to program tasks and responses, as well as to create my assistant and build the training model.

I ended up building most of the follow out in Studio, and then realized I Could do this entire process from within the tool. I wanted to at least upload these scripts so you could see some of the work.

Feel free to try it out, just text anything to - 1-256-365-0553 and see for yourself!!



I could easily make this much much more robust, but I didn't want to take too long getting this all back to you.
